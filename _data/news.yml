  Our project "Remotely-assisted Enhanced Mirror Therapy (REMiT)" has been awarded with the "Quality of Life" label from the 
  <a href="https://dallemolle.ch/concours-2023-ceremonie-de-remise-des-prix/">Fondation Dalle Molle</a>.
  With the VRHEM project we developed a system leveraging VR technology and a hand exoskeleton (provided by <a href="https://emovocare.com">emovo</a>) to enahance traditional Mirror Therapy.<br>
  With REMiT we build on top of this to unlock telemedicine features: we allow therapists to remotely connect with their patients and supervise the therapy session.
