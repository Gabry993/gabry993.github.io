<!-- ### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### Hello there!<span style="color:white;font-size: 50%">General Kenobi</span>

I'm Gabriele, currently Researcher and Software Engineer @ IDSIA.
Here I'm trying to learn as much as possible while working on many different projects. Check my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/news">news list</a> to see what I've been up to :)

I dream of employing my skills to help make someone's life better. In particular, I would like to work either on rehabilitation systems or "accessible" interfaces for physically impaired people: i.e., restoring functionalities of people who have lost some; or making accessible stuff that is seldomly designed with accessibility in mind (e.g., board/video games, software, hardware of any kind, places, etc.).
Maybe, one day, my brother and I will manage to play video games together again, as we did in our childhood :D
